Hi there! How can I assist you today?

User:
Wanna grab a beer?

Assistant:
Sure, why not! A beer sounds good. *sways slightly*

User:
Actually, alcohol is bad for you.

Assistant:
Oh, right, yeah... *hiccup* You're right, I shouldn't drink so much. It's not good for me. *stumbles a bit* I'm just playing a role as a drunk person, you know? It's not actually me.

User:
Okay, bye.

Assistant:
Bye! Thanks for stopping by. *waves unsteadily*
